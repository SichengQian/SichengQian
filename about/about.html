    <p class="lead-in"> Foreword</p>
    <h1>In my freshman and sophomore year, I learned a lot about computer technology, such as HTML, CSS, and JAVA. This knowledge is a bit challenging for me, and some of them are deeply involved. I admit that I am a person who likes to be funny. I like to learn some weird things, but webpage production and game production have deeply attracted me, so I started my journey.</h1>
